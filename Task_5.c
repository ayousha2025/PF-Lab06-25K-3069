//You are an event planner tasked with organizing a series of workshops. Each workshop requires a different 
//number of participants, and you need to determine the total ways to arrange these participants for one 
//workshop. Your task is to calculate the factorial of the number of participants. The factorial of a number n 
//(denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example: If there are 5 participants, the 
//total arrangements would be 5! = 54321 = 120.
